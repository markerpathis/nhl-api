# NHL Schedule App using NHL API

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT_License-blue.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

## Description

My objective of this project was to create a single page React app to continue practicing my React skills.

This is an app to view upcoming NHL games. Users can select a date using the calendar to view upcoming games for 7 days from their selected date. If the user views a previous date or current day, they can view the final or live scores of the games. Users are also able to filter by team.

Thank you user dword4 for documenting the NHL API:
